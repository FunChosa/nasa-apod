# Project README

## Overview

This project utilizes various technologies to enhance its functionality. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

## Technologies Used

1. **NASA API**
    * [https://api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov)
    * This project leverages the NASA API to access a vast repository of space-related data.

2. **Data Caching**
    * Data fetched from the NASA API is cached in the browser's `localStorage` using today's date as the key. 
    * This approach optimizes performance by reducing the number of API requests and loading data faster for subsequent visits.

3. **Font Awesome Icons**
    * [https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome)
    * [https://fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com)
    * Font Awesome icons are integrated to provide a visually appealing and consistent iconography throughout the project.

4. **Spin Animation using Keyframes**
    * CSS `keyframes` are used to create a smooth spinning animation for specific elements, enhancing user experience.
